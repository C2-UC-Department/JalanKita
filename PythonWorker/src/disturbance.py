"""Step 9: parking disturbance -- the road area a parked vehicle takes out of use.

Turns the amodal mask into a NUMBER. Two top-down rasters of the same scene are
compared:

  amodal BEV   the road as it actually is        (Mask2Former road + OFRSNet patch)
  visible BEV  the road as the camera sees it    (Mask2Former road alone)

Their difference is road that exists but is not usable, i.e. the functional space
the occluders consume. Rectifying to the ground plane FIRST is what makes this
measurable: in the image a far-away square metre is a handful of pixels and a
near one is thousands, whereas every BEV cell is the same size, so counting cells
is measuring area (src/bev.py).

Per-vehicle attribution is then geometric, not a full-mask warp. The ground-plane
homography is only valid for pixels that truly lie on the plane; a vehicle's
roof/hood/windshield do not, and warping them smears its claimed BEV region away
from the camera past its true position. Only a vehicle's BOTTOM CONTOUR is near
the plane, so attribution seeds come from that contour alone, projected to BEV
and rasterised into a small footprint band (src/bev.py), then propagated to the
rest of its occluded shadow by nearest seed.

Metric scale (camera height) is estimated AUTOMATICALLY by default, from
detected cars' roof heights above the fitted plane (src/instances.py
`estimate_camera_height_from_vehicles`) -- no manual input needed. It falls
back to a fixed assumption only when no car in the scene qualifies. Pass
--camera-height to override with a known value.

Usage:
    python -m src.disturbance --input data/RealWorld/IMG_0864.jpg
    python -m src.disturbance --input img.jpg --vehicle 2 --json
    python -m src.disturbance --input data/footage_frames --limit 10
    python -m src.disturbance --input img.jpg --no-instance-model    # blobs only
    python -m src.disturbance --input img.jpg --camera-height 1.4    # known height

For interactive vehicle selection see `streamlit run app.py`.
