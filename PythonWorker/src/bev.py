"""Bird's-eye view: metric top-down rasters of the fitted ground plane.

No new geometry is estimated here. Step 7 already caches, per image, the
intrinsics K and the RANSAC ground plane n in the `n . X = 1` parameterisation
(see src/geometry.py). Those two alone define an exact homography between the
image and a metric top-down grid on that plane:

    a ground point (X, Z) has  Y = (1 - n_x X - n_z Z) / n_y

which is AFFINE in (X, Z), so the whole image <-> BEV relation is a single 3x3
matrix -- no per-pixel scatter, no hole filling, one cv2.warpPerspective.

This is the analytic inverse of `geometry.derive_ground_fields`, which computes
the same plane's forward ray intersection G = t * K^-1 [u,v,1]^T. Consequence
worth stating: the BEV is guaranteed consistent with the geometry OFRSNet was
actually trained on -- same plane, same intrinsics, same sign convention -- and
`tests/test_bev.py` asserts the two agree rather than trusting a fixture.

Conventions (identical to src/geometry.py): OpenCV camera frame, x right,
y DOWN, z forward; n in 1/metres; K in pixels at the resolution it was built
for. BEV row v=0 is the FAR edge, so a raster reads like a map with the camera
at the bottom.
